Migrate 2.0 Beta 3
==================
Features and enhancements

- #989200 - Support "dynamic" migrations. Changes to be aware of:
  All modules implementing migration classes must now implement hook_migrate_api()
    (see migrate_migrate_api() for an example).
  Dependencies and sourceMigrations must now be expressed in terms of 
    machine name rather than class name.
  MigrationBase::getInstance now takes a machine name rather than a class name. 
  Migration class names are no longer required to end in 'Migration'.
- #992898 - Pass options to source and destination constructors as arrays.
Add logging of fetch queries and dqp() function to translate DBTNG query object into full SQL.
Inherit default settings for promote, sticky, status, status from content type 
  configuration. Already done in D7.

Add dedupe() method for a field mapping.

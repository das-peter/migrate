Migrate 2.0 dev release
===========
Version 2 of the Migrate module is an entirely new implementation. Documentation
has not yet begun - for now, review the migrate_example module for information 
on how to implement migrations. The first priority is developing the API and
drush commands for managing migrations - the UI has not been implemented yet,
and is provided by a distinct module: migrate_ui.

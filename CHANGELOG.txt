Migrate 1.0 Beta 1
===========

IMPORTANT!

If you have been using a development version of the migrate module, please note that
shortly before the release of beta 1 some refactoring was done that requires manual attention.

Updating from a version before 2009/08/23:

All hook names containing "destination" no longer contain "destination". The update function
will attempt to identify hook implementations you will need to rename, but please go through
your code carefully to make sure there's nothing else that needs to change. Also, the content
set pages are now under admin/content/migrate/content_sets (rather than
admin/content/migrate/destinations).

The map and message table names have been renamed. If you have constructed any views
specifically accessing these tables, the views will be to be reconstructed.

Updating from a version before 2009/08/18:

The way content_profile mappings are stored has changed - if you are migrating users
using content_profile, you must edit your user content sets and reestablish your mappings 
to any content_profile fields.

Migrate 2.0 dev release
===========
Version 2 of the Migrate module is an entirely new implementation. Documentation
has not yet begun - for now, review the migrate_example module for information 
on how to implement migrations. The first priority is developing the API and
drush commands for managing migrations - the UI is provided by a distinct 
module: migrate_ui.

-------
Field handler classes now need to define a constructor, passing an array of
the field types they handle to parent::__construct($field_types). Destination 
handler classes should now be derived from MigrateDestinationHandler
instead of MigrateHandler, and pass an array of the destination types they handle
to parent::__construct($types). See plugins/destinations/fields.inc for examples.

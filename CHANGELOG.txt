2009/06/14
- #490930 - Refactoring to improve API and UI around destination definitions:
    hook_migrate_init() no longer needs to return anything.
    hook_migrate_destination_types() returns have changed:
      For simple destinations, such as comments, return array('comment' => t('Comments'))
      For destinations supporting multiple types, such as nodes, for each type return the base 
        destination ('node') followed by a / and the subtype ('page'). E.g.,
        array('node/page' => t('Node: Page'), 'node/story' => t('Node: Story'), ...)
    The Content Sets page has been simplified - no more destination "kinds" and "types",
      just "Destinations".
    Roles are no longer used to define differ user "types" for migration, they are now
      migrated as a mapped field consisting of a comma-separated list of either role IDs
      or role names.

- #479828 - Refactored map and message tables. Any code or custom views referencing these
    tables must be changed.

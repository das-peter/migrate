Migrate 1.0-dev
===========

IMPORTANT!

Until we have the first stable beta, there may be incompatible changes that require you
to take manual action when updating the migrate module (i.e., you can't assume update.php
will handle everything for you).

Updating from a version before 2009/08/23:

All hook names containing "destination" no longer contain "destination". The update function
will attempt to identify hook implementations you will need to rename, but please go through
your code carefully to make sure there's nothing else that needs to change. Also, the content
set pages are now under admin/content/migrate/content_sets (rather than
admin/content/migrate/destinations).

Updating from a version before 2009/08/18:

The way content_profile mappings are stored has changed - if you are migrating users
using content_profile, you must edit your user content sets and reestablish your mappings 
to any content_profile fields.

- #490930 - Refactoring to improve API and UI around destination definitions:

    hook_migrate_destination_types() returns have changed:
      For simple destinations, such as comments, return array('comment' => t('Comments'))
      For destinations supporting multiple types, such as nodes, for each type return the base 
        destination ('node') followed by a / and the subtype ('page'). E.g.,
        array('node/page' => t('Node: Page'), 'node/story' => t('Node: Story'), ...)
    The Content Sets page has been simplified - no more destination "kinds" and "types",
      just "Destinations".
    Roles are no longer used to define differ user "types" for migration, they are now
      migrated as a mapped field consisting of a comma-separated list of either role IDs
      or role names.

Migrate 1.0-dev
===========

2009/06/15
- #492324 - Drop map and message tables when deleting content set.

2009/06/14
- #490930 - Refactoring to improve API and UI around destination definitions:
    hook_migrate_init() no longer needs to return anything.
    hook_migrate_destination_types() returns have changed:
      For simple destinations, such as comments, return array('comment' => t('Comments'))
      For destinations supporting multiple types, such as nodes, for each type return the base 
        destination ('node') followed by a / and the subtype ('page'). E.g.,
        array('node/page' => t('Node: Page'), 'node/story' => t('Node: Story'), ...)
    The Content Sets page has been simplified - no more destination "kinds" and "types",
      just "Destinations".
    Roles are no longer used to define differ user "types" for migration, they are now
      migrated as a mapped field consisting of a comma-separated list of either role IDs
      or role names.
- #463830 - Support for text primary keys in sources.
- #491368 - Added support for migrating roles

2009/06/09
- #486538 - Add method to bypass views load in migrate_save_content_set()
- Added migrate_add_mapping() - standard API for hooks to add mappings from source
    to destination.

2009/06/03
- Added CHANGELOG.txt
- #479828 - Refactored map and message tables. Any code or custom views referencing these
    tables must be changed.

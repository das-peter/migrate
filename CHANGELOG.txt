Migrate 2.0 Beta 3
==================
Features and enhancements
- #989200 - Support "dynamic" migrations. Changes to be aware of:
  MigrationBase::getInstance now takes a machine name rather than a class name. This
    means that dependencies and sourceMigrations must now be expressed in terms of 
    machine name (remove "Migration" from the end).
  All migration constructors now take a single parameter, $arguments. Add
    "array $arguments = array()" as the parameter to all your migration constructors,
    and pass it to the parent:  parent::__constructor($arguments);
Allow migration of comment enable/disable.

Bug fixes
- #984294 - Make migrate dashbard a local task.
needs_update => needs-update to match drush conventions.
- #959400 - Better way to get vid for vocabulary.

Migrate 2.0 Beta 2

Migrate 2.0 Beta 1
==================

Conventions to make porting changes between Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 easier:

Try to always use specific DBTNG functions such as db_select() instead of the more
general db_query(), which needs to be renamed to dbtng_query() under Drupal 6.


TODOs for initial backport to Drupal 6:

Autoload module: Add support for .info parsing, or implement hook_autoload_info
Autoload matches classes case-insensitively - can we relax that?
Replace Field API stuff with CCK stuff
No is_new support (insert with specified ID) in D6
Create aliases for D7 functions missing in D6 (d7.inc):
  *_load_multiple (comment, taxonomy_term, node, user, file)
  *_delete_multiple
  taxonomy_term_load (taxonomy_get_term)
  taxonomy_term_save (taxonomy_save_term)
  taxonomy_term_delete (taxonomy_del_term)
  taxonomy_vocabulary_delete (taxonomy_del_vocabulary)
Term relationships to nodes - taxonomy_node_* instead of fields
comment.inc: Changes needed for D6 comment_save() (form assumptions)
node.inc: Excerpt/teaser handling
fields.inc: File API changes

Conventions to make porting changes between Drupal 6 and Drupal 6 easier:

Try to always use specific DBTNG functions such as db_select() instead of the more
general db_query(), which needs to be renamed to dbtng_query() under Drupal 6.

Known differences to maintain:

comment.inc uses db_query() for an INSERT IGNORE (should become db_merge())
sqlmap.inc uses db_table_exists()

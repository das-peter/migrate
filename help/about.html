<p>The Migrate module provides a flexible framework for migrating content into Drupal 
from other sources (e.g., when converting a web site from another CMS to Drupal). 
Out-of-the-box, support for creating Drupal nodes, users, and comments is included - 
hooks permit migration of other types of content.</p>

<p>The combination of the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/tw">Table Wizard</a> and 
Migrate modules is designed to support a migration process along these lines:</p>

<ol>
<li>Import - Table Wizard can be used to import external data into tables in your
Drupal database. Any tables in your Drupal database, or in other databases on the
same server, can be made available to views for review and migration.</li>
<li>Analysis - Table Wizard performs analysis of table data (ranges, sizes, etc.), and
supports collaborative documentation of table fields.</li>
<li>Migration - Migrate takes data from the views enabled by Table Wizard and creates
Drupal objects from them. Migration is reversable - migrated data can be backed out and
migrated again. A dashboard is provided to easily manage the process. Background processing
via cron is supported for large migrations.</li>
<li>Auditing - Errors and other conditions flagged during migration are flagged and can be reviewed
in views (TBD). Also, Migrate maintains mapping tables from the source data to the
resulting Drupal objects, enabling the creation of comparison views.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Status</h3>

<p>Migrate is <b>not ready</b> for official release. There is currently 
<a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/21338">some discussion</a> in the 
<a href="http://groups.drupal.org/content-migration-import-and-export">Content migration, 
import, and export</a> group on future directions for the various migration and 
import/export-related modules which may affect the design of the migrate module.</p>

<p>Another requirement for official release is complete documentation, with solid 
real-world examples (you are now reading an early draft of this documentation).
This is a complex module addressing a complex problem space,
and a large proportion of issues reported to date have either involved the (lack of)
documentation directly, or at least been partially due to misunderstandings of what 
the module does and how it does it.</p>

<p>Finally, I consider a suite of simpletests a prerequisite to release.</p>

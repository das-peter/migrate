<p>The <a href="/admin/content/migrate/tools">tools page</a> provides a quick method
  for deleting all node content of a given type. In the process of migrating into a
  new Drupal site, you may have manually created test nodes. And, when developing
  hooks in more complex migrations, errors may have caused nodes to be created without
  being tracked in the map tables, so they don't get cleared normally.</p>
<p>If you are <strong>absolutely sure</strong> you want to delete all nodes of a given
  type, check the box next to the node type and click <strong>Delete nodes</strong>.

<p>To get the most out of the migrate module, one should understand the following concepts:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Content set</dt>
    <dd>This represents a set of source content (embodied in a view) to be migrated.
        It includes mappings from columns in the view
        to fields within Drupal objects.</dd>
  <dt>Destination</dt>
    <dd>A Drupal object designated to receive migrated data from a source view.
        Most destinations are simple - roles, terms, users - but nodes are more
        complex - each distinct node type defined in your Drupal site is a
        distinct destination in the migrate module.</dd>
  <dt>Clear</dt>
    <dd>A flag indicating that a given content set is to be cleared (usually with the 
        intention of importing it again with changes to the process). When all
        imported content has been deleted, the flag is turned off.</dd>
  <dt>Import</dt>
    <dd>A flag indicating that a given content set is to be imported from the data 
        represented by a content set. The relationship between a row in the source view and 
        the resulting Drupal object is maintained in a map table. When there are no
        more rows in the source view to process, the import flag is turned off.</dd>
  <dt>Scan</dt>
    <dd>This content set flag has the same effect as Import, but the flag is not
        turned off when all available rows have been processed. This is used in a 
        situation where more data may be added to the source view over time - when
        cron (or an external automated drush script) is run it will import the new
        data.</dd>
  <dt>Map tables</dt>
    <dd>A table associated with each content set, holding mappings from the unique
        ID of a source view row to the unique ID of the Drupal object created from
        that row. This is used to keep track of which rows have been processed, and
        can also be used to develop audit views directly comparing source data to
        resulting Drupal data.</dd>
  <dt>Primary key</dt>
    <dd>In relational databases, a table's <em>primary key</em> consists of one or more
        columns which are unique for each row and never null, explicitly designated
        to uniquely identify each row. The migrate module uses this term to 
        describe a unique non-null column for a source view - in most cases, this
        will actually be the primary key of the base table of the view, but you
        may designate another unique column to function as a primary key for
        the purpose of migration. This column is used as the source ID in map
        tables.</dd>

<p>The <a href="admin/content/migrate/dashboard">dashboard page</a> is used to monitor 
   and control migration processes.</p>

<h3>Processes</h3>

<p>All content sets are listed here in order of weight. For each content set listed, 
   you will see the following items:</p>
   
<dl>
  <dt>Clear/Import/Scan</dt>
    <dd>These toggles enable processes to run - see the glossary for details.</dd>
  <dt>Content Set</dt>
    <dd>The name of the content set. This name can be used to specify a particular content
        set in a drush command. It is linked to the edit page for the content set.</dd>
  <dt>Source</dt>
    <dd>The source view for the content set. It is linked to the edit page for the view.</dd>
  <dt>Rows in set</dt>
    <dd>A count of the total rows in the source view.</dd>
  <dt>Imported</dt>
    <dd>A count of the Drupal objects successfully created for this content set. If
        any of these objects generated informational messages (conditions interesting
        enough to report, but not severe enough to prevent successful import) there
        will be a link to the messages here.</dd>
  <dt>Unimported</dt>
    <dd>A count of source rows which have not yet been migrated, or which failed to migrate
        successfully. If there were any failures, there will be links to the messages here.</dd>
  <dt>Last imported</dt>
    <dd>The date and time that the last import or scan completed.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Any content set currently processing (i.e., whose semaphore is on) is 
  <span class="migrate-running">highlighted</span>.</p>

<h3>Interactive mode</h3>

<p><a href="http://drupal.org/project/drush">Drush</a> is the preferred means of running
  migration processes, and they can also be run in the background via cron. However, 
  particularly while developing your migration processes, you may want to run processes
  directly in the browser. To do so, check the <em>Enable</em> checkbox here and submit
  the form. You may set the following parameters for an interactive run:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Sample size</dt>
  <dd>If set, this number of rows of each checked content set will be processed before completion.</dd>
  <dt>Source IDs</dt>
  <dd>If set to a comma-separated list of primary keys from the source view, those specific
    IDs will be run through each checked process. This is useful when determining a problem
    processing a specific row of source data.</dd>
</dl>
<p>When running in interactive mode, first any Clear actions are run in reverse order,
then any Import and Scan actions are run in forward order.</p>

<h3>Unstick migration process</h3>

<p>It would be dangerous to run multiple processes on the same content set at the same
time - for example, running a Clear in the browser while an Import is running in cron. To
guard against this, a semaphore flag is set on a content set while it is processing, and
cleared when it is done. Sometimes, a programming or system problem can interrupt a process
so it fails to clear its flag. Check this toggle and Submit to clear all semaphores (but
please be sure to verify first that no process really is running).</p>

<p>Performing a large migration exercises a Drupal installation in different ways
than normal production usage. There are several things you can do to improve the
performance of your migration processes.</p>

<h3>.htaccess</h3>

<p>If you are going to upload large files through Table Wizard, you should increase
the following parameters, as well as increasing Drupal's
<a href="&base_url&admin/settings/uploads">maximum file upload values</a>:</p>

<pre>
  php_value max_input_time      600
  php_value upload_max_filesize 255M
  php_value post_max_size       255M
</pre>

<p>Bulk creation and deleting of nodes and users can strain memory usage - you
should consider significantly boosting <em>memory_limit</em>:</p>

<pre>
  php_value memory_limit       256M
</pre>

<p>When performing a migration process interactively, the Migrate module monitors
execution time and exits a few seconds before max_execution_time or max_input_time
is exhausted, to avoid partial updates. It is recommended to set them to a few minutes:</p>

<pre>
  php_value max_execution_time 240
  php_value max_input_time 240
</pre>

<h3>Drupal 6 Core patches</h3>

<p>In normal Drupal usage, nodes and users are created and deleted one at a time -
thus, the core is optimized for that kind of load and is not well optimized for
the bulk operations that the Migrate module performs. The following patches are
recommended to help your performance when performing migrations.</p>

<p>node_delete() unnecessarily caches the node being deleted - when hundreds or
thousands of nodes are deleted in a single request, you can very quickly run out of memory.
Go to <a href="http://drupal.org/node/287063">issue #287063</a> and apply the patch
in comment #8 to prevent this caching.</p>

<p>Deleting a user updates the comments and node_comment_statistics tables rows
referencing that user's uid, but those columns are not indexed, making deletion
of users in bulk very slow. The patch at
<a href="http://drupal.org/node/289504">http://drupal.org/node/289504</a> addresses
this.</p>

<p>Note: These patches have already been incorporated into Drupal 7.

<p>The <a href="/admin/content/migrate/content_sets">Content Sets administration page</a>
manages content sets you have created, and allows you to create new content sets.</p>

<p>The upper area of the page lists existing content sets, ordered by weight initially (you
may resort by any column, by clicking its header). Each content set's <em>Description</em>
links to its editor, and each <em>Source view</em> links to the editor for the view.</p>

<p>In the lower area of the page, you may create a content set, providing these parameters:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
    <dd>A user-friendly name for the content set, used for display in various places. It
        also may be used to specify which content set to process on a drush command.</dd>
  <dt>Destination</dt>
    <dd>The Drupal object which this content set will populate. The migrate module has
        builtin support for the following Drupal objects, and you can also use hooks
        to define customer destinations:
        <ul>
          <li>Comment</li>
          <li>Node (a separate destination is provided for each different content type
              defined on your site)</li>
          <li>Taxonomy term</li>
          <li>User</li>
          <li>Role</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
  <dt>Source view</dt>
    <dd>A <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">view</a> containing the source data
        for this content set. This view must contain a single row for each destination
        object to be created (e.g., a single row per user, or per Page node). It also
        must have at least one unique data column.</dd>
  <dt>Weight</dt>
    <dd>A numerical value used to order content sets in listings, and when processing
        multiple content sets in a single operation. For example, if you are migrating
        roles, then assigned migrated roles to users, you should give your role content
        set a lower weight than the user content set so it is processed first.</dd>
</dl>

<p>When you click the <strong>Add</strong> button, the content set is created, with its 
   primary key defaulted to the primary key of its base table (if there is one), and the
   content set's edit page is displayed to allow you to add mappings.</p>
